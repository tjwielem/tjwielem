### Hi there 👋, I'm Tom Wielemaker

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for robotics and machine learning. Here are a few of my key experiences:

💻 Previous Software Engineering Intern at [Untether AI](https://www.untether.ai/) where I decomposed and mapped Multi-Headed and Group-Query Attention to an at-memory, 2D spatial hardware architecture. Along with writing dynamic compute kernels for many of the operations in BERT and Llama 3, notably including non-linear activation functions along with frame norm functions approximated with splines and taylor series.

🚗 Previous Machine Learning Perception Intern at [Potential Motors](https://www.potentialmotors.com) where I worked on AI-powered terrain perception software.

🏎️ Previous Student Researcher at University of Waterloo, where I worked on techniques to make Gaussian Splatting real time feasible to enhance Autonomous Vehicle's understanding of 3D dynamic scenes.

🧬 Previous Machine Learning Bioinformatics Research Intern at Canada's [National Microbiology Laboratory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/programs/national-microbiology-laboratory.html), where I experimented with various machine learning classifiers (especially hierarchical classifiers) to determine the geographic source location of Salmonella isolates.

📃 Previous NLP Deep Learning Research Intern at Canada's [National Microbiology Laboratory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/programs/national-microbiology-laboratory.html), where I built a Large Language Model system for researchers to query scientific articles about Enteric Diseases.

🤖 Previous Robotics Software Research Assistant the University of New Brunswick's [Robotics and Mechanisms Labortory](https://ram.ext.unb.ca), where I worked on embedded software to transfer data under UART protocal, control motors with motor drivers, and efficienty read various sensors using direct port manipulation and ISRs
