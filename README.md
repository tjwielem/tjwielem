### Hi there üëã, I'm Tom Wielemaker

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for robotics and machine learning. Here is are a few of my key experiences:

üöó Current Machine Learning Perception Intern at [Potential Motors](https://www.potentialmotors.com) where I am working on AI-powered terrain perception software.

üèéÔ∏è Current Student Researcher at University of Waterloo, where I'm researching the use of neural rendering algorithms to enhance vehicles/robots' dynamic scene understanding

üß¨ Returned as a Machine Learning Bioinformatics Research Intern at Canada's [National Microbiology Laboratory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/programs/national-microbiology-laboratory.html), where I experimented with various machine learning classifiers (especially hierarchical classifiers) to determine the geographic source location of Salmonella isolates.

üìÉ Previous NLP Deep Learning Research Intern at Canada's [National Microbiology Laboratory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/programs/national-microbiology-laboratory.html), where I built a Large Language Model system for researchers to query scientific articles about Enteric Diseases.

ü§ñ Previous Robotics Software Intern at the University of New Brunswick's [Robotics and Mechanisms Labortory](https://ram.ext.unb.ca), where I worked on embedded software to transfer data under UART protocal, control motors with motor drivers, and efficienty read various sensors using direct port manipulation and ISRs
